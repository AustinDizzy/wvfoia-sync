# wvfoia-sync

This project syncs a local SQLite database with the contents of the [(WV)FOIA Database maintained by the West Virginia Secretary of State's Office](https://erls.wvsos.gov/FOIA_Database/Search).

* https://l.abs.codes/data/wv-foia - browse and query the database via Datasette
* [Latest Release (v1.0.2025-04-24)](https://github.com/AustinDizzy/wvfoia-sync/releases/latest) - download the latest database in full

The database is updated automatically every day at 4AM Eastern Time and published via a new GitHub Release. The updated database is then immediately available on the Datasette instance.

## Usage

```
$ python3 main.py --help
usage: main.py [-h] [--mode {range,retrieve,crawl}] [--db DB] [--verbose] [-d] [--range RANGE] ...

wvfoia-sync cli syncs the WVSOS FOIA Database from the web to a local SQLite(3) database

positional arguments:
  ids                   ID

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --mode {range,retrieve,crawl}
                        change the sync mode
  --db DB               database file
  --verbose             verbose output
  -d, --debug           debug output
  --range RANGE         range of IDs to sync (requires 'range' mode)
```

There are three primary modes:
* **range** - does a random spray retrieval on entries between a range (ex. 1 - 1000)
* **crawl** - begins a crawl from a last known entry ID and continues until the first unknown entry
* **retrieve** - simply retrieves the details from one (or multiple) FOIA Database entries and displays them
